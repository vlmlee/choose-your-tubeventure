# Choose your tubeventure!

Ever want to create your own text-based adventure game
but wanted something more interactive? This react app
allows you to do just that!

### About:

This project was inspired mostly by [Adventure Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfKhDiUNOG0) from Limmy's Show.

### You will need:

* A youtube video.
* A weekend.

### To create, follow these steps:

#### Step 1:
Enter the youtube link of a video into the create form.

#### Step 2:
Describe your project with a name, description, created by, and a secret word in the storyboard. The secret word will allow you to edit the project later.

#### Step 3:
Create a breakpoint by clicking “CREATE BREAKPOINT+” in the storyboard to generate a form that you can input a start time, a pause time, and choices that will be shown to the player.

#### Step 4:
Enter a title for the breakpoint and a start and pause time. The start time indicates when the video should start and the pause time indicates when to pause and show the player choices to choose from. This forms an interval [start time, pause time] for which the video can deliver an exposition.

#### Step 5:
Add choices to the breakpoint by clicking “ADD CHOICE+”. To remove the breakpoint, delete all the choices within the breakpoint with “REMOVE CHOICE-”.

#### Step 6:
Edit the choices using the “EDIT CHOICE” button. The “description” will be the text displayed in the choice boxes when viewed by a player. “Go to” will be the time the player jumps to when she clicks on a choice and “Next pause time” will be the time the video stops to show her the next set of choices. The breakpoints you create do not have to be in order but the interval of each breakpoint (i.e. [start time, pause time]) cannot overlap.

#### Step 7:
Create alternative endings by clicking “CREATE ENDING+”. The “description” will be the text displayed to the user and the “ending time” will be when the video stops.

#### Step 8:
Create the adventure and play test it! If you decide you want to continue editing it, press the “Edit Adventure” link on the lower right hand corner of the video. Then, enter your secret word to proceed and make changes.

#### Step 9:
Share the link to have others play your adventure!
